# Python_Person_Database
This is a simple implementation of a program that can store, retrieve, and delete information from a database using Python and SQLite.

Tools Used:
----
Python (version 3.7),
SQLite3 

Python (version 3.7) must be installed on your computer. Sqlite3 is a database tool already imported inside of my solution.

How To Use:
-----------------
1. Download this project. Open your terminal and navigate to where the project is located on your computer using ‘cd’ (for example, cd Desktop) until you are inside of ‘Python_Person_Database’. Now, type in ‘python demo.py’ to run the program.
2. From here, everything is done in the terminal. The solution includes prompts that take your input depending on what you want to do. For example, if it says to ‘type in 1 to see data about files’, typing in ‘1’ and pressing enter will take you where you want to go. 
3. All data is stored using SQLite3. Using this, databases are stored in the project files once created. If you quit your terminal and open up a new one to run the program, this data will still be saved.
4. When you enter in new files to score, this part of the program allows you to continue or quit entering new files. It will help you correct yourself if you mistype information about files. If you want to view data you can choose an option, but the program will end after accomplishing it’s task. For seeing entries between dates, there is no support for mistakes here, so please make sure that what you enter here is correct. 
5. You will know that the program is done or has quit when the terminal goes back to its default state. Type in ‘python demo.py’ to run the program once again (make sure you are still in the same location on your computer -- otherwise, redo step one).

Note: While this entire program is run in the terminal and does accomplish its tasks, a more ideal solution would involve an simple and more visually-engaging user interface. This is a future consideration.
